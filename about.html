	<h1>What's Jive?</h1>

	<p>Second fridays of the month in the back room at Arc Nightclub. Grab that fedora and slip on those wingtips; we're rocking the classic dance sounds with a modern club feel! Electroswing has already taken Europe by storm - we're joining the movement here in the States.</p>

	<p>This ain't your father's jazz: expect high energy and infectious grooves from today's hottest tracks. Our DJs spin modern dance music borrowing heavily from the classic swing sounds of prohibition all the way up to modern nujazz and deep funk. Custom cocktails designed by our partner-in-crime, Brother Cleve.</p>
		
	
	<h2>What's electroswing?</h2>

	<p>Like many umbrella genres that encompass a wide range of sounds, electroswing's roots are varied and complex. A number of early one-off tracks form the basis of the genre, as artists from hiphop and electronica experimented with jazz sounds and influences. As such, there's some debate and dischord as to who had the first real "electroswing" track - and who really even wants to call their work electroswing.</p>

	<p>The early years of electronic music had very strong roots in jazz music. If we look as far back as the grandfathers of electronica, Kraftwerk, we find that even they were jazz musicians. The first self-titled Kraftwerk album has a jam band feel to it, and is performed with traditional instruments. Who could put together a retrospective about electro without mentioning Herbie Hancock - himself a jazz legend - and his seminal track 'Rockit', which featured not just unforgettable synth lines but even a turntablism pioneer, Grandmixer D.S.T.</p>

	<p>Turntablists and DJs in hiphop and other genres used elements from jazz, swing, gospel and soul samples and breaks that became critical to their sound. Amen (Winston Brothers), Apache (Incredible Bongo Band), and other popularly sampled breaks are readily found in many 80's and 90's hiphop releases and was inherited by early breakbeat artists in the 90's. Electroswing's roots had been laid as electronic music in its entirety had jazz in its blood from the start.</p>

	<p>Enter swinghouse.  The earliest complete subgenre to make up electroswing, swinghouse blends funky house beats with swing samples.  The influential French/Chicago based swinghouse label G-Swing first released in 1992, among others that were working with swing samples in their music. Unfortunately, the genre died down in early 2000s (and really, so did a lot of electronic music), but new funky house style with similar aesthetics called "Jackin' House" has brought about a recent resurgence of swinghouse.</p>
